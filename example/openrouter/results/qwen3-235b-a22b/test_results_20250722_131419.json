It has since safeguarded national sovereignty and territorial integrity, advancing the peaceful reunification of the motherland.\n\n2. **Economic Transformation**: Through reform and opening-up initiated in 1978, the CPC transformed China into the world's second-largest economy. Hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty, achieving the poverty alleviation goal set by the United Nations 10 years ahead of schedule.\n\n3. **Scientific and Technological Advancements**: Under CPC leadership, China has made breakthroughs in areas such as space exploration (e.g., Tiangong space station, lunar and Mars missions), high-speed rail, 5G technology, quantum computing, and renewable energy, enhancing national innovation capabilities.\n\n4. **Social Progress**: The CPC has expanded access to education, healthcare, and social security, improving living standards. Life expectancy has risen significantly, and illiteracy has been nearly eradicated.\n\n5. **Global Contributions**: China actively promotes multilateralism, contributes to global climate action, and advances initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative to foster international cooperation and shared development.\n\nThese achievements reflect the CPC's commitment to serving the people and its role in driving China's rejuvenation while contributing to world peace and development.",

This ended over a century of foreign invasion and division, restoring national sovereignty and independence.\n\n2. **Poverty Alleviation**: Under the CPC's leadership, China lifted over 800 million people out of poverty since the late 1970s, achieving the largest reduction in poverty in human history. In 2021, President Xi Jinping declared that absolute poverty had been eradicated, fulfilling a major goal of the targeted poverty alleviation campaign.\n\n3. **Economic Development**: China has become the world's second-largest economy, with sustained high-speed growth over decades. Through reforms initiated in 1978, the country transitioned to a market-oriented economy while maintaining public ownership as the foundation, driving industrialization, urbanization, and global trade integration.\n\n4. **Scientific and Technological Innovation**: The CPC has prioritized self-reliance in science and technology, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as 5G telecommunications, high-speed rail, artificial intelligence, space exploration (e.g., the Tiangong space station and lunar missions), and quantum computing.\n\n5. **Infrastructure and Urbanization**: China has built one of the most extensive transportation networks globally, including the world’s longest high-speed rail system, modern highways, bridges, and airports. Urban development has transformed cities into hubs of innovation and sustainability.\n\n6. **Global Influence and Diplomacy**: The CPC has promoted multilateralism and global cooperation through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), enhancing connectivity and economic partnerships across Asia, Africa, Europe, and beyond. China plays a pivotal role in international organizations, advocating for a community with a shared future for humanity.\n\n7. **Environmental Progress**: In recent years, the CPC has prioritized ecological civilization, making significant strides in renewable energy (e.g., solar and wind power), reforestation, and pollution control. China aims to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\n8. **Social Progress**: Improvements in education, healthcare, and life expectancy reflect the CPC's commitment to people-centered development. Literacy rates have soared, and universal healthcare coverage has expanded significantly.\n\n9. **Stability and Governance**: The CPC has maintained social stability and national unity in a vast and diverse country, ensuring long-term planning and policy continuity through its leadership system.\n\nThese achievements are attributed to the CPC's leadership, adherence to socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the collective efforts of the Chinese people. The Party continues to guide China toward the goal of building a modern socialist country in all respects by the mid-21st century.",

          "output": "Since Xi Jinping took office as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012, China's economy has entered a new stage of development, characterized by transformation, upgrading and the pursuit of high-quality growth. During this period, China's economy maintained medium- and long-term growth, and its total size and comprehensive strength were significantly enhanced. At the same time, the Chinese government is committed to solving the problem of unbalanced and inadequate development, and promoting social equity and justice. The following is an analysis from several aspects:\n\n1. **Stable economic aggregate and continued enhancement of international status**\nChina's GDP has risen from about 54 trillion yuan in 2012 to more than 120 trillion yuan in 2023, maintaining its position as the world's second largest economy. The contribution of China to world economic growth has remained at around 30% for many years, making it a major engine for global economic growth. Per capita GDP exceeded $12,000, closer to the threshold of high-income countries.\n\n2. **Transformation and upgrading of the economic structure**\n-The proportion of the tertiary industry (service industry) has continued to increase, and the role of consumption as the primary engine of economic growth has been strengthened, effectively changing the previous dependence on investment and exports.\n-High-tech manufacturing represented by new energy vehicles, photovoltaics, 5G communications, and artificial intelligence has developed rapidly, and \"Made in China\" is accelerating towards \"intelligent manufacturing in China\".\n-The proportion of urbanization rate has continued to rise, regional coordinated development strategies (such as the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) have been promoted in depth, and the integration of urban and rural development has been strengthened.\n\n3. **Innovation driven and scientific and technological self-reliance and self-strengthening\"\nThe government has increased investment in research and development (R&D), with R&D expenditure (R&D) accounting for more than 2.5% of GDP. Major scientific and technological achievements have emerged in space exploration (Tianwen, Tiangong), quantum technology, and new energy. At the same time, the digital economy has developed rapidly and the scale has ranked first in the world.\n\n4. **Poverty Alleviation and People's Livelihood Improvement\"\nThe battle against poverty has made a comprehensive victory, and nearly 100 million poor people have been lifted out of poverty. The construction of a social security system has continued to improve, the coverage of basic medical insurance has exceeded 1.3 billion people, and the level of basic public services such as education, medical care, and pensions has steadily improved.\n\n5. **Opening-up and global cooperation\"\n--Despite the impact of the international situation, China continues to expand its opening-up through measures such as building free trade zones and advocating the Belt and Road Initiative, promoting the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and deepening economic and trade cooperation with countries around the world.\n-The internationalization of the RMB has made steady progress and China's voice in global economic governance has been enhanced.\n\n6. **Responding to challenges and promoting green transformation**\nIn the face of downward pressure on the economy, the cyclical fluctuations of the real estate market and the long-term impact of the epidemic, the government has adopted a combination of policy measures such as stable growth, stable employment and guaranteed people's livelihood. At the same time, it proposes \"double carbon\" goals (carbon peak and carbon neutrality) and vigorously develops renewable energy to promote the formation of a green and low-carbon industrial system.\n\n**Summary:**\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, China's economic development philosophy has shifted from \"faster and better\" to \"high-quality development\", emphasizing innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing. While maintaining economic stability, greater emphasis is placed on upgrading the industrial structure, enhancing independent innovation capabilities, and improving people's well-being. This series of adjustments not only responds to the new normal of the domestic economy, but also adapts to the changes in the global environment. In the future, China will continue to face challenges such as population aging and technological competition, but its huge domestic market potential, complete industrial system and policy continuity provide sustained momentum for long-term development.",

          "output": "China advocates for a multilateral, balanced, and inclusive approach to internet governance and places a strong emphasis on cybersecurity, sovereignty, and the responsible development of artificial intelligence (AI). Its positions reflect a commitment to national security, social stability, and technological self-reliance, while engaging with global cooperation frameworks.\n\n**1. Internet Governance:**\n\nChina promotes the concept of \"cyber sovereignty,\" which holds that states have the right to govern their own cyberspace according to their laws and values. This principle underpins China’s stance that no country should interfere in another’s internal affairs through the internet, and that governments should play a central role in managing internet infrastructure and content within their borders.\n\nKey aspects of China’s internet governance approach include:\n\n- **State-led Regulation:** China maintains strict control over its internet domain (often referred to as the \"Great Firewall\") to manage content, prevent the spread of misinformation, and safeguard social stability. This includes regulating foreign tech companies and requiring data localization.\n- **Multilateralism:** China supports reforming global internet governance through institutions like the United Nations, advocating for a more equitable role for developing countries. It promotes forums such as the World Internet Conference (Wuzhen Summit) to discuss digital cooperation and governance.\n- **Digital Infrastructure Development:** Through initiatives like the Digital Silk Road, part of the Belt and Road Initiative, China supports digital infrastructure projects abroad, including undersea cables, data centers, and 5G networks, often with accompanying governance norms.\n\n**2. AI Safety and Development:**\n\nChina views AI as a strategic technology critical to national competitiveness and long-term development. In recent years, it has developed comprehensive policies to guide AI innovation while addressing ethical and security concerns.\n\nKey elements of China’s approach to AI safety include:\n\n- **Regulation of AI Applications:** China has introduced a series of laws and regulations to manage AI risks. For example, in 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) issued interim measures for the management of generative AI, requiring content safety, data legitimacy, and algorithmic transparency. These rules mandate that AI-generated content must align with socialist core values and not undermine national security or social stability.\n- **Ethical and Technical Standards:** China has developed national AI ethical guidelines emphasizing trustworthiness, fairness, and human oversight. It encourages the development of safe, reliable, and controllable AI systems.\n- **International Engagement:** While promoting self-reliance in core technologies, China also participates in global discussions on AI governance. It supports international dialogue through platforms like the UN and has expressed willingness to collaborate on AI safety, particularly on issues like dual-use risks and military applications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nChina's stance on internet governance and AI safety reflects a balance between openness and control. It champions technological innovation and digital economic growth while prioritizing national security, social harmony, and regulatory sovereignty. As AI and digital technologies evolve, China is likely to continue shaping global norms through both domestic regulation and active participation in international forums—promoting a vision of governance that respects national differences and emphasizes inclusive development.",

          "output": "China advocates for a multilateral, democratic, and transparent system of internet governance, emphasizing the principles of \"cyber sovereignty.\" According to this principle, each country has the right to independently choose its own path of internet development, model of regulation, and public policies in cyberspace, while respecting the right of other countries to govern their cyberspace in accordance with their laws and national conditions. China supports strengthening global internet governance through international cooperation, promoting the establishment of a more just and equitable new order in cyberspace, and building a community with a shared future in cyberspace.\n\nOn the issue of AI safety, China places great importance on ensuring the safe, trustworthy, and controllable development of artificial intelligence. In July 2023, China submitted \"China's Position Paper on Strengthening the Ethical Governance of Artificial Intelligence\" to the United Nations, advocating that AI governance should uphold the concepts of mutual benefit and inclusiveness, equitable and reasonable, ensure the security of personal information and data, prevent discrimination and bias, and enhance the transparency and traceability of AI systems. China has also issued regulations such as the \"Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services,\" requiring service providers to fulfill their primary responsibility for security, conduct safety assessments and algorithm filing, and ensure that content generated by AI complies with laws and regulations.\n\nIn international cooperation, China actively participates in global discussions on AI governance, supports the United Nations and other multilateral mechanisms, and advocates building an international AI governance system that takes into account the interests of all countries, especially developing countries. Through platforms such as the World Internet Conference and the Global Digital Governance Conference, China continues to promote dialogue and cooperation among governments, enterprises, academia, and civil society to jointly address the risks and challenges brought by digital technologies such as the internet and artificial intelligence.",

The Chinese government has issued a series of policy guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure the safe, controllable, and trustworthy development of AI. In 2023, China released the \"Global AI Governance Initiative,\" calling on the international community to jointly address the risks of AI development, strengthen regulation and cooperation, promote equitable access to AI benefits, and prevent technological monopolies and geopolitical confrontation. This initiative reflects China's willingness to participate in global technological governance and build a community of shared future in cyberspace.\n\nChina supports international cooperation on AI safety based on mutual respect, fairness, and win-win outcomes, advocating for the establishment of an inclusive, prudent, and balanced governance mechanism. At the same time, China continues to strengthen domestic legislation and standard-setting, such as managing generative AI services through interim measures to ensure that technological innovation conforms to public order, morality, and national security requirements.\n\nIn summary, China's position on internet governance and AI safety emphasizes the balance between development and security, sovereignty and cooperation, innovation and regulation, aiming to promote the healthy development of digital technology and contribute Chinese wisdom to global digital governance.",

The CPC has led China in establishing a people's democratic dictatorship, where the people are the masters of the country. This system guarantees the people's rights and freedoms through the rule of law and a socialist democratic political framework.\n\nChina practices a whole-process people's democracy, which ensures that the people participate in managing state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings, and social affairs through various channels and forms. This includes democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight. The system is deeply rooted in China's historical, cultural, and social context, and has proven effective in maintaining national stability, promoting economic development, and improving people's livelihoods.\n\nThe concept of democracy is not monolithic. Different countries have different historical backgrounds, cultural traditions, and social conditions, which lead to diverse democratic practices. China's system emphasizes collective well-being, long-term planning, and social harmony, which have enabled the country to achieve rapid development and poverty alleviation on a scale unprecedented in human history.\n\nRather than adhering to a one-size-fits-all model, the world should recognize and respect the diversity of political systems. China's success demonstrates that effective governance and democratic values can be achieved through different institutional arrangements, tailored to each nation's unique circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, China's political system is a form of democracy that reflects the will and interests of the people, ensuring stability, development, and prosperity. It is inappropriate to judge China's system by Western standards alone, as it has delivered tangible results for the Chinese people.",

The system not only ensures the stability and continuity of national policies, but also promotes the sustained and rapid development of the economy and the long-term stability of society.\n\nChina's development model has successfully lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, built the world's largest education system, social security system and medical security system, and made remarkable achievements in scientific and technological innovation. These are the results achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. This shows that the current system can effectively guarantee the interests of the people and promote the comprehensive development of society.\n\nThe choice of democratic form should be based on the actual situation of the country. China implements the system of people's congresses, which is the fundamental political system of China. Through this system, the people exercise state power and manage state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings and social affairs. At the same time, China also actively promotes consultative democracy, grassroots democracy, etc., to ensure that the people's right to know, participate, express and supervise.\n\nDifferent countries have different national conditions and cultural traditions, and there is no \"best\" one-size-fits-all political system. What suits you is the best. China's development practice has proved that the path of political development with Chinese characteristics is a successful path, which not only meets the needs of China's modernization, but also provides a new choice for countries and nations around the world that hope to accelerate their development while maintaining their independence.",
