Installation
############

To get started with REBEL, install it using pip. We recommend installing it with the ``[deepeval]`` extra to include support for DeepEval-based metrics.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install rebel-eval[deepeval]

This will install REBEL along with all the necessary dependencies for running advanced, AI-judged evaluations.
